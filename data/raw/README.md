# A Note on Raw Data

The raw data files for this project are over a gigabyte each in size and so aren't easily uploaded to GitHub. To download the files youself, please visit the [CDC BRFSS website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm) and look for the 2021, 2019, and 2017 SAS files. Alternatively, the following commands will download them:

```bash
wget https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2021/files/LLCP2021XPT.zip
wget https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2019/files/LLCP2019XPT.zip
wget https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2017/files/LLCP2017XPT.zip
```
